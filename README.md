Quick note:

The code is set by default to 10.000 numbers, but if you change that number in the lines 10 and 77 (although this one is not necessary) you can analize up to any number.

However, I am not an expert in Python (I haven't even finished high school (Aparte de que hablo Español)). Consequently, the code may not be very efficient with high numbers, but, the only thing that im sure is that it works
